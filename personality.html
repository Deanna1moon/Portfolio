        <h2>My Personality and Academic Life</h2>
        <p>One of my strongest traits is <span class="highlight">Prospecting</span>, which means I am naturally flexible, curious, and adaptable. I enjoy exploring different learning methods instead of following strict routines. This allows me to stay open to new ideas and adjust easily to academic challenges.</p>

        <p>However, my ability to keep options open also means I sometimes work best under pressure. I tend to approach tasks with spontaneity, which helps me find creative solutions even at the last minute.</p>

       </br> <h3>How My Hobbies Support My Learning</h3>
        <p>My hobbies—playing video games, watching shows, and reading—have a direct impact on my academic performance:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Gaming</span> helps me improve critical thinking, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Badminton</span> enhances my reaction time, and physical capabilities and maintain good health .</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Reading</span> strengthens my vocabulary, comprehension, and analytical thinking, which are useful for writing and research.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of these activities contributes to my ability to **adapt, think critically, and develop innovative solutions** in academic and real-world scenarios.</p>

			and successfuly formed a pirate crew with him as the captin , he was able to surround himself with people who care and encourages him and
				continue to push past his limit during difficult times and though fictional continues to motivate me during my journey of achieving my own goal.</p>

            <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
            <p>I took the 16 Personalities test, and the results described me as a <strong>Mediator (INFP-A)</strong>, which emphasizes my poetic, kind, and principle thinking.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> To a large extent. It captures my creative thinking, strong empathy, and adaptability. However, in certain situations, I can also exhibit traits from other personality types, which is why I don't view these results as absolute or rigid.</p>
